# Computer Science 1 - CS1113

This class was my first programming class at Oklahoma State and played a huge part in my decision to switch majors from Computer Engineering to Computer Science. 

# Notes

I was new to college when I took this, and therefore was not as organized as I am now. Because of this, some of my assignments are lost in the void of some flash drive I probably threw away or something. But I've gathered as many as I could!
