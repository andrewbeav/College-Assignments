# Programming Intelligent Robots

## Info about class

This is a class I took my second semester at Oklahoma State. It was an honors add-on for Computer Science 2 where we used [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) to write python programs that ran on turtlebots. This class was a lot of fun, very challenging, and I learned about things such as...
* PID controllers
* Finite State Automata
* Computer Vision (Specifically, we used OpenCV)
* Path Planning
* Particle Filters

## What's Included in This Repository?

* All assignments from this class are included in this repository with the exception of...
	* Assignment 1 - This was just doing some tutorials and I felt it was unnecessary to put in here
	* Assignment 4 & 5 - These were actually just adding on to Assignment 3, so are included in that package.
