# Assignment 6 - Robot Soccer Tournament

Assignment 6 was to write a program for the turtlebot to participate in a soccer tournament against my classmates (well, my classmates code running on another turtlebot). It brought together **ALL** of the previous assignments. Unfortunately, I lost in the first round, but my code still worked! The interesting code is located at ./scripts/soccer_player.py
