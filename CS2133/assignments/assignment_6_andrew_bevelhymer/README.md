# Assignment 6 - Work In Progress

This assignment was one of the last ones of the Semester, and therefore coincided with several due dates for other classes. Due to this (and also in large part to the laziness that plants itself in every college student on planet Earth towards the end of April) I didn't devote as much time on this assignment as I did the others. However, I will be revising it over the Summer since it involves some interesting topics.
