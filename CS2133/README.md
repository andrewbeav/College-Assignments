# Computer Science 2 - CS2133

This class was one of my favorite classes the Semester I took it (my favorite was the Add-on for this class, Programming Intelligent Robots). This class taught me how to be a much better programmer. We did some cool and interesting projects in this class, such as creating a version of Minesweeper and implementing the Huffman Compression algorithm.
